# WAVEGEN Function Generator

... <br>

As of my concept, QGraphicsView and QGraphicsScene can work together to 
form a wave shape composer. Actually QGraphicsScene can contain multiple 
types of graphics item as a container, then QGraphicsView can help visualize 
the items. mimic.py is just a window of 3 tabs for now. The 2nd tab contains 
the QGraphicsView Container. We may need to inherit QGraphicsScene for 
wave shape drawing functionality. <br>
